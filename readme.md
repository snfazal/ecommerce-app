#Technologies Used

nerd-crunch is built using Javascrip, MongoDB, Express, Angular.js, and Node.js. This full CRUD MEAN stack application is structured with RESTful routes.

#Approach Taken

At first we started by taking into consideration the best way to utilize the features of an application that could create, read, update and destroy. eCommerce platforms are a complex way to monetize full CRUD applications, they're fun and interesting too.

Once we had our base model, we worked around the details by creating wireframes of our ideal eCommerce app. Wireframes turned into user stories as we found ourselves inside the mindset of a user. Using GitHub we were able to create user stories, identify technologies and even divide [tasks](https://github.com/snfazal/ecommerce-app/issues).

Choosing to focus on tasks we were weaker in handling helped push us through the project. So the execution of some features took pair-programming, precise scheduling, and lots of communication in order to get to production.

#Final Thoughts

This project really helped us visualize what it takes to monetize an application for end users. There were several battles we faced through the planning period that helped us get through the development process. One of the main battles was the checkout cart and how we wanted the checkout to work specifically for ease of purchase.
